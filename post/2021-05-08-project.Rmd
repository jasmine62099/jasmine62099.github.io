# This is a Guide on how to use Python and R together. 

### First let's discuss some simple Python coding

##### Printing/Displaying items in Python
This is done using a print() command
```{python}
print("Hello World")
```
##### Assigning values in Python
This is done using an = operator
```{python}
a = "Hello World "
b= 5

print (a*b) #this will print a five times
```
##### Working with lists in Python
A python list is creates using square brackets- []. One difference between R and Python vectors/lists is that Python list index starts at 0 rather than 1
```{python}
c = [1,2,3,4,5]
print (c[0]) #will give you the first element
print (c[1]) #this will give you the second element
print (c[0:3]) #this will return the first index to the third, but does NOT include the third index

```

# Now let's work with reticuate

##### First we need call the library in r
```{r}
library(reticulate)
```


##### Lets now create variables in both r and python
This is a r variable
```{r}

r_var<- c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7)

```

This is a python variable
```{python}

p_var = [8,9,10]

```


##### Accessing Python in R
This is done using a py$varName where varName is the variable name in python
```{r}
c(r_var, py$p_var)
```
##### Accessing R in Python
This is done using a r.varName where varName is the variable name in r
```{python}

print(r.r_var + p_var)

```
# Conclusion

##### Being able to communicate between teo language is extremely powerful because you are able to use unique funtionalities of each together. Python has several different other libraries/packages such as pandas and matplot.lib that make it easier to go through the data.
